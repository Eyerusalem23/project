          <p>  The third episode of Succession season 4 broke the internet minutes after it dropped. 
            Titled Connor’s Wedding, the episode left fans shocked as it introduced a devastating shocker. 
            And in just two days, the episode found itself on top of IMDb’s TV show list.
            With close to 14,000 votes, the episode has been given 10 stars by fans. One user wrote, “A masterpiece.
             I’m still shaken & processing what I’ve just seen 24 hours after watching it & I’m going to have to watch it again to fully take it all in.
              It was THAT good, and that 27 minute single take scene! How? I mean, just how? I’m gobsmacked.” Another one added, “As someone who had the 
              pleasure to watch this episode early I can say with confidence that it’s the best hour of television to air in 2023 so far. It’s the definition of a masterpiece.”
              Another review on the show’s page read, “I’m still reeling from that, more than 24 hours later. What else is there to say? If this episode doesn’t absolutely sweep at the Emmy’s, 
              then there’s more politics among voters than the Roy siblings themselves. In all seriousness – this show is an absolute blessing & I’m as nervous & excited for the rest of this final 
              season as I would be a major exam.”
              Widely lauded by critics and audiences, Succession has picked up Emmy Awards and Golden Globes as a series, for its writing and its actors since it first premiered in 2018. It has been compared to media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s 
              dynasty, however, show creator Jesse Armstrong said it was not based on one family. Actor Brian Cox earlier told Reuters that the season is going to be a ‘roller coaster’ ride. “We’re going to see a lot of fascinating rides and it’s
               a bit like a roller coaster.
               I think it’s… finishing in the true Succession style… I think people are going to love it… A lot of American shows go on well past their sell by date. That would never happen to our show.”
              The actor plays Logan Roy in the comedy-drama series. In this season, fans will see Logan edge closer to selling his company to tech boss Lukas Matsson, creating more family divisions and power struggles. Logan’s four children,
               all vying for control of the family’s vast media holdings, are played by Jeremy Strong, Kieran Culkin, Sarah Snook and Alan Ruck.
               The final season of Succession dropped on March 27. The remaining seven episodes is been releasing every Sunday on HBO.
